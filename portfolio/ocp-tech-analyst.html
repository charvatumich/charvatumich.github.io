						<p class="close-top">
							The Owosso Community Players are a theater group that have been performing in Mid-Michigan since the 1950s at the Lebowski
							Center in downtown Owosso. I had the pleasure of interning with OCP during the summer of 2016, and my task was to
							bring online ticketing to the theater. This evolved to include CRM software, as well as a complete redesign of the
							website. Price was a major concern as well, as OCP is a non-profit organization. </p>
						<p>After researching online ticketing options by comparing marketed features, online reviews, interviews with sales representatives,
							and interviews with current users, I compiled a short report to review with the Executive Director. Once we had decided
							on a solution that met all our criteria, I needed to update the website to make it compatible with the online ticketing
							system. Because we would already be making changes to the site, we also decided to make a full re-design and modernization
							of the website a part of the project as well. You can visit the site by clicking the button below.</p>

							<br> While interning with the Owosso Community Players, I had the pleasure of working directly under the Executive Director.
							She helped me more thoroughly consider the needs of OCP in my search for great technology solutions, everything from
							financial to donor relations to creative control. This needs evaluation, combined with professional business communication
							and presentation practice, has helped me become a better experience evaluator and persuasive communicator.</p>

						<h5>Sponsorship Marketing Materials</h5>
						<p>While at OCP, I didn’t just work on technology solutions and web development, I also aided in marketing material design.
							By clicking the button below, you can see the 2016-2017 sponsorship advertisement and form I helped create with guidance
							from the executive director. This form was used to show sponsors of the theater all the available programs they could
							sponsor, as well as provide them information about what that sponsorship would entail. Lastly, it was designed to
							give sponsors a method of giving within the document. Since this project occurred in 2016, I have developed a much
							greater understanding of design and human factors. However, it still stands as a marketing product that fulfilled
							its organization requirements. </p>

						<h5>Revamped Webhosting and Online Ticketing Integration</h5>
						<p>During this activity at OCP, I acted as both an IT administrator and Front-End web-developer. First, a requirement
							for our new ticketing and CRM provider was for our website to have an SSL certificate. In the process of working with
							the hosting company to achieve this, I also changed the site to allow for load-balancing to be implemented on the
							site. This made the site much more stable, especially as they see large traffic spikes when new performances become
							available and marketing campaigns begin. </p>
						<p>At the same time, I used the ticketing companies web integration guide to serve contact from the ticketing provider
							to users on OCP’s site. This required a host of changes be made to the code of the website, including HTML and JavaScript
							to host the content, and CSS to make it beautiful and user-friendly.
						</p>
						<p>When you browse the site and enter the ticketing process on the OCP site, you can see the results of these activities.
							This can be found by clicking the button below.
